Created and primarily written by author and former police reporter [[David Simon]], the series was broadcast by the premium cable network [[HBO]] in the United States. ''The Wire'' premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 [[List of The Wire episodes|episodes]] over five seasons. Each season of ''The Wire'' introduces a different facet of the city of Baltimore. In chronological order they are: the [[illegal drug trade]], the [[seaport]] system, the city government and bureaucracy, the school system, and the print news media. The large cast consists mainly of [[character actor]]s who are little known for their other roles. Simon has said that despite its presentation as a crime drama, the show is "really about the American city, and about how we live together. It's about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a [[longshoreman]], a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed."<ref name="TAR">{{cite video|people = David Simon|date = 2005|title = "The Target" commentary track|medium = DVD|publisher = [[HBO]]}}</ref> Despite only receiving average ratings and never winning major television awards, ''The Wire'' has been described by many critics and fans as one of the greatest [[Dramatic programming|TV dramas]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2007/09/15/best_show/|title=The best TV show of all time|date=September 15, 2007|last=Traister|first=Rebbeca|accessdate=March 7, 2008|publisher=[[Salon.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5095500/The-Wire-arguably-the-greatest-television-programme-ever-made.html|title=The Wire: arguably the greatest television programme ever made |date=April 2, 2009|work=Telegraph|accessdate=April 2, 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/jul/21/thewireisunmissabletelevis|title=The Wire is unmissable television|date=July 21, 2007|accessdate=September 7, 2009|publisher=guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=Jon | last=Wilde}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/feb/13/thewire|title=A show of honesty|date=February 13, 2007|accessdate=September 7, 2009|publisher=guardian.co.uk | location=London | first=Kevin | last=Carey}}</ref><ref>Roush, Matt (February 25, 2013).

Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using [[surveillance]] technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore police department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his intimate familiarity with the city. During his time as a writer and producer for the [[NBC]] program ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', based on his book ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'' and also set in Baltimore, Simon had come into conflict with NBC network executives who were displeased by the show's pessimism. Simon wanted to avoid a repeat of these conflicts. He chose to take ''The Wire'' to [[HBO]] because of their existing working relationship from the 2000 [[miniseries]] ''[[The Corner]]''. HBO was initially doubtful about including a police drama in its lineup, but eventually agreed to produce the pilot episode.<ref name="SLI">{{cite web|author = Ian Rothkirch|year = 2002|title = What drugs have not destroyed, the war on them has|publisher = [[Salon.com]]|accessdate =|url = http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/tv/int/2002/06/29/simon/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last = Alvarez|first = Rafael|year = 2004|title = The Wire: Truth Be Told|publisher = [[Pocket Books]]|location = New York|pages = 18–19, 35–39}}</ref> Simon approached the [[mayor of Baltimore]], telling him that he wanted to give a bleak portrayal of certain aspects of the city; he was welcomed to work there again.

Each episode begins with a [[cold open]] that seldom contains a dramatic juncture. The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in. The show's opening title sequence then plays; a series of shots, mainly close-ups, concerning the show's subject matter that changes from season to season, separated by [[fast cutting]] (a technique rarely used in the show itself). The opening credits are [[superimposition|superimposed]] on the sequence, and consist only of actors' names without identifying which actors play which roles. In addition, actors' faces are rarely seen in the title sequence. At the end of the sequence, a quotation is shown on-screen that is spoken by a character during the episode. The three exceptions were the [[Sentencing (The Wire)|first season finale]] which uses the phrase "All in the game", attributed to "Traditional West Baltimore", a phrase used frequently throughout all five seasons including that episode; the [[Final Grades|fourth season finale]] which uses words written on boarded up vacant homes attributed to "Baltimore, traditional" and the [[–30– (The Wire)|series finale]], which started with a quote from [[H. L. Mencken]] that is shown on a wall at ''The Baltimore Sun'' in one scene, neither quote being spoken by a character. Progressive story arcs often unfold in different locations at the same time. Episodes rarely end with a [[cliffhanger]], and close with a fade or cut to black with the closing music fading in. === Music === Rather than overlaying songs on the soundtrack, or employing a score, ''The Wire'' primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as [[source cue]]s. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.<ref>{{cite web|year = 2006|title = On The Corner: After Three Seasons Shaping The Wire's Background Music, Blake Leyh Mines Homegrown Sounds For Season Four|publisher = [[Baltimore City Paper]]|accessdate =|url = http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=12203}}</ref> The opening theme is "[[Way Down in the Hole]]", a [[gospel music|gospel]]- and [[blues]]-inspired song originally written by [[Tom Waits]] for his 1987 album ''[[Frank's Wild Years]]''. Each season uses a different recording of it against a different opening sequence, with the theme being performed, in order, by [[The Blind Boys of Alabama]], Waits himself, [[The Neville Brothers]], DoMaJe and [[Steve Earle]]. Season four's version of "Way Down in the Hole" was arranged and recorded specifically for the show, and is performed by five Baltimore teenagers: Ivan Ashford, Markel Steele, Cameron Brown, Tariq Al-Sabir, and Avery Bargasse.<ref>{{cite web|year = 2006|title = "The Wire" on HBO: Play Or Get Played, Exclusive Q&A With David Simon (page 16)|accessdate =October 17, 2007|url = http://www.borderline-productions.com/TheWireHBO/exclusive-16.html}}</ref> Earle, who performed the fifth season's version, is also a member of the cast, playing the recovering drug addict [[Street level characters of The Wire#Walon|Walon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/thewire/cast/characters/walon.shtml|title=Character profile – Walon|accessdate=March 12, 2008|publisher=HBO|year=2008}}</ref> The closing theme is "The Fall", composed by [[Blake Leyh]], who is also the show's music supervisor. During season finales, a song is played before the closing scene in a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] showing the major characters' lives continuing in the aftermath of the narrative. The first season montage is played over "Step by Step" by [[Jesse Winchester]], the second "I Feel Alright" by Steve Earle, the third "Fast Train" written by [[Van Morrison]] and performed by [[Solomon Burke]], the fourth "I Walk on Gilded Splinters" written by [[Dr. John]] and performed by [[Paul Weller]], and the fifth uses an extended version of "Way Down In The Hole" by the Blind Boys of Alabama, the same version of the song used as the opening theme for the first season. While the songs reflect the mood of the sequence, their lyrics are usually only loosely tied to the visual shots. In the commentary track to episode 37, "[[Mission Accomplished (The Wire)|Mission Accomplished]]", executive producer David Simon said: "I hate it when somebody purposely tries to have the lyrics match the visual. It brutalizes the visual in a way to have the lyrics dead on point.&nbsp;... Yet at the same time it can't be totally off point. It has to glance at what you're trying to say."<ref name="Complete1"/> Music by the [[Celtic punk]] band, [[The Pogues]], is used throughout the series. The band's song "The Body of an American", which is always played at the detectives' wakes at Kavanaugh's Bar occurs in three separate episodes. In the episode "[[Dead Soldiers]]", the song "[[Sally MacLennane]]" can be heard when Bunk and McNulty are drinking on the street outside Kavanaugh's Bar. The song "Transmetropolitan" is heard in the opening sequence of the episode "[[Duck and Cover (The Wire)|Duck and Cover]]" during season two, where McNulty crashes his car while drunk. Two soundtrack albums, called ''[[The Wire: And All the Pieces Matter—Five Years of Music from The Wire]]'' and ''[[Beyond Hamsterdam]]'', were released on January 8, 2008 on [[Nonesuch Records]].<ref name = "Nonesuch">{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/nonesuch-to-release-music-from-five-years-of-the-wire#TheWireHBO|title=Nonesuch to Release Music from Five Years of "The Wire"|date=November 12, 2007|accessdate=November 14, 2007}}</ref> The former features music from all five seasons of the series and the latter includes local Baltimore artists exclusively.<ref name = "Nonesuch"/> == Style == === Realism === The writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences. Simon, originally a journalist for the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', spent a year researching a homicide police department for his book, ''[[Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets]]'', where he met Burns. Burns served in the [[Baltimore Police Department]] for 20 years, and later became a teacher in an inner-city school. The two of them spent a year researching the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book, ''[[The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood]]''. Their combined experiences were used in many of the storylines of ''The Wire''. Central to the show's aim for realism was the creation of truthful characters. Simon has stated that most of them are composites of real-life Baltimore figures.<ref name="TGU">{{cite news|author = Richard Vine|year = 2005|title = Totally Wired|url = http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/theguide/archives/tv_and_radio/2005/01/totally_wired.html|work = [[The Guardian|The Guardian Unlimited]]|accessdate =April 9, 2010| location=London}}</ref> For instance, [[Donnie Andrews]] served as the main inspiration of Omar Little.<ref name=balsun>{{cite news|last=Fenton |first=Justin |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bal-donnie-andrews-inspiration-for-omar-character-on-the-wire-dies-20121214,0,3207915.story |title=Donnie Andrews, inspiration for Omar character on "The Wire," dies |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=December 14, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2012}}</ref> [[Martin O'Malley]] served as "one of the inspirations" for [[Tommy Carcetti]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sweetland Edwards |first=Haley |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/may_june_2013/features/should_martin_omalley_be_presi044513.php?a_aid=3598aabf&page=2 |title=Should Martin O’Malley Be President? by Haley Sweetland Edwards |work=The Washington Monthly |date=May/June 2013 |accessdate=October 20, 2013}}</ref> The show often cast non-professional actors in minor roles, distinguishing itself from other television series by showing the "faces and voices of the real city" it depicts.<ref name="Stealing Life">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/22/071022fa_fact_talbot?currentPage=1|title=Stealing Life|accessdate=October 14, 2007|publisher=The New Yorker|year=2007|author=Margaret Talbot}}</ref> The writing also uses contemporary slang to enhance the immersive viewing experience.<ref name="Stealing Life"/> In distinguishing the police characters from other television detectives, Simon makes the point that even the best police of ''The Wire'' are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. However, while many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, ''The Wire'' does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.<ref name="TAR" /> The show is realistic in depicting the processes of both police work and criminal activity.

Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. Salon.com has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows.<ref name="SLN"/> Each season of ''The Wire'' consists of 10–13 full-hour episodes, which form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw a viewer in, which then results in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews,<ref name = "SLI" /><ref>Alvarez 28, 35–39.</ref> describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show's themes in time not spent on plot development.<ref name="TAR"/> === Social commentary === [[File:TheWireBaltimore.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Murderland Alley" is both realistically and bleakly portrayed.]] Simon described the second season as <blockquote>"a meditation on the death of work and the betrayal of the American working class ... it is a deliberate argument that [[neoliberalism|unencumbered capitalism]] is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact<!--This is a direct quotation, please do not change to "social contract". Why the [sic]? This is a valid use of the phrase, and the [sic] is not int he original article.-->, raw capitalism is destined to serve the few at the expense of the many."<ref name="TGU" /></blockquote> He added that season 3 "reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals." The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the [[Iraq War]] and [[Prohibition (drugs)|drug prohibition]],<ref name="TGU" /> which in Simon's view has failed in its aims<ref name="RSN" /> and has become a war against America's underclass.<ref>Alvarez 12.</ref> This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims. Writer [[Ed Burns]], who worked as a public school teacher after retiring from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for.<ref>{{cite web|year = 2006|title = Interviews—Ed Burns|publisher = [[HBO]]|accessdate =|url = http://www.hbo.com/thewire/interviews/ed_burns.shtml}}</ref> Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.<ref>{{cite web|year = 2006|title = Behind The Scenes Part 1—A New Chapter Begins|publisher = [[HBO]]|accessdate =|url = http://www.hbo.com/thewire/behindthescenes/ontheset/part1.shtml}}</ref> == Themes == === Institutional dysfunction === Simon has identified the organizations featured in the show—the [[Baltimore Police Department]], City Hall, the [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore public school system]], the [[Barksdale Organization|Barksdale drug trafficking operation]], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', and the [[stevedore]]s' union—as comparable institutions. All are dysfunctional in some way, and the characters are typically betrayed by the institutions that they accept in their lives.<ref name="TAR" /> There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics—"Shit rolls downhill"—which describes how superiors, especially in the higher tiers of the police department in the series, will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals. Simon described the show as "cynical about institutions"<ref name="RSN" /> while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters.<ref name="RSN" /> A central theme developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group's goals. Whether it is Officer Jimmy McNulty using all his cards to pursue a high-profile case despite resistance from his own department, or gang member D'Angelo Barksdale accepting a 20-year prison sentence contrary to his strong desire to turn in his uncle Avon and walk, this type of conflict is pervasive in all aspects of the show. === Surveillance === Central to the structure and plot of the show is the use of electronic surveillance and [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] technologies by the police—hence the title ''The Wire.'' [[Salon.com]] described the title as a metaphor for the viewer's experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer.<ref name="SLN">{{cite web|author = Dan Kois|year = 2004|title = Everything you were afraid to ask about ''The Wire''|publisher = [[Salon.com]]|accessdate =|url = http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2004/10/01/the_wire/index.html?pn=4}}</ref> Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters' need to sift through this information.<ref name="TAR" /> == Cast and characters == {{Main|List of The Wire characters}} {{stack| [[File:TheWire32.jpg|thumb|225px|The police: from left, [[Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski]], [[Cedric Daniels]], [[Jimmy McNulty]], [[Lester Freamon]] (seated), [[Rhonda Pearlman]], and [[Kima Greggs]]]] [[File:Wire07.jpg|thumb|225px|The Barksdale crew: from left, [[Wee-Bey Brice]], [[Stringer Bell]], [[D'Angelo Barksdale]], [[Poot Carr]], and [[Bodie Broadus]]]] [[File:TheWire21alt.jpg|thumb|225px|The docks; from left, [[The Greek]], [[Nick Sobotka]], and [[Frank Sobotka]]]] [[File:TheWire43.jpg|thumb|225px|The politicians: from left, [[Tommy Carcetti]], [[Clay Davis]], and [[Norman Wilson (The Wire)|Norman Wilson]]]] [[File:TheWire49.jpg|thumb|225px|The Stanfield crew: from left, [[Chris Partlow]], [[Marlo Stanfield]], [[Snoop (The Wire)|Felicia "Snoop" Pearson]], [[O-Dog (The Wire)|O-Dog]], and [[Cheese Wagstaff]]]] [[File:TheWireS4.jpg|thumb|225px|The schools: from left, [[Duquan "Dukie" Weems]], [[Randy Wagstaff]], [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael Lee]] and [[Namond Brice]]]] }} ''The Wire'' employs a broad ensemble cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions featured in the show. The majority of the cast is black, which accurately reflects the [[Baltimore#Demographics|demographics of Baltimore]]. This is a rarity in American television drama. On February 3, 2008, with the airing of its 55th episode, ''The Wire'' became the second-longest running dramatic series with a predominantly black cast in the history of American prime-time television. Only ''[[Soul Food (TV series)|Soul Food]]'' has aired more episodes. The show's creators are also willing to kill off major characters, so that viewers cannot assume that a given character will survive simply because of a starring role or popularity among fans. In response to a question on why a certain character had to die, [[David Simon]] said, <blockquote>We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. ''The Wire'' is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show.<ref>{{cite web|author = David Simon|year = 2003|title = David Simon Answers Fans' Questions|publisher = [[HBO]]|accessdate =|url = http://www.hbo.com/thewire/interviews/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031204070427/http://www.hbo.com/thewire/interviews/index.html |archivedate=December 4, 2003}}</ref></blockquote> === Main cast === The major characters of the [[The Wire (season 1)#Cast|first season]] were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in [[drug-related crime]]. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective [[Jimmy McNulty]] ([[Dominic West]]), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator. The detail was led by Lieutenant [[Cedric Daniels]] ([[Lance Reddick]]) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. [[Kima Greggs]] ([[Sonja Sohn]]) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her [[informant|criminal informant]], a drug addict known as [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]] ([[Andre Royo]]). Like Greggs, partners [[Herc (The Wire)|Thomas "Herc" Hauk]] ([[Domenick Lombardozzi]]) and [[Ellis Carver]] ([[Seth Gilliam]]) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo's initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as [[comic relief]] for the audience.<ref name="SLN" /> Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives [[Lester Freamon]] ([[Clarke Peters]]) and [[Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski]] ([[Jim True-Frost]]). Though not initially important players in the operation, Freamon proved a quietly capable and methodical investigator with a knack for noticing tiny but important details, and Prez turned out to be a natural at following paper trails and his persistence when dealing with seemingly unbreakable codes paid off eventually. These investigators were overseen by two commanding officers more concerned with politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner [[Ervin Burrell]] ([[Frankie Faison]]) and Major [[William Rawls]] ([[John Doman]]). Assistant state's attorney [[Rhonda Pearlman]] ([[Deirdre Lovejoy]]) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had a sexual relationship with McNulty. In the homicide division, [[Bunk Moreland]] ([[Wendell Pierce]]) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under [[Jay Landsman (The Wire)|Sergeant Jay Landsman]] ([[Delaney Williams]]), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. [[Peter Gerety]] had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.<ref name="SLN" /> On the other side of the investigation was [[Avon Barksdale]]'s drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale ([[Wood Harris]]) was aided by business-minded [[Stringer Bell]] ([[Idris Elba]]). Avon's nephew [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] ([[Larry Gilliard, Jr.]]) ran some of his uncle's territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience, while loyal [[Wee-Bey Brice]] ([[Hassan Johnson]]) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon's orders. Working under D'Angelo were [[Poot Carr|Poot]] ([[Tray Chaney]]), [[Bodie Broadus|Bodie]] ([[J. D. Williams]]), and [[Wallace (The Wire)|Wallace]] ([[Michael B. Jordan]]), all street-level drug dealers.<ref name="SLN" /> Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped in the drug trade,<ref name="SLN" /> and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead. [[Omar Little]] ([[Michael K. Williams]]), a renowned Baltimore stick-up man robbing drug dealers for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan. The [[The Wire (season 2)#Cast|second season]] introduced a new group of characters working in the Baltimore port area, including [[Spiros Vondas|Spiros "Vondas" Vondopoulos]] ([[Paul Ben-Victor]]), [[Beadie Russell]] ([[Amy Ryan]]), and [[Frank Sobotka]] ([[Chris Bauer]]). Vondas was the underboss of a global smuggling operation, Russell an inexperienced [[Port authority]] officer and single mother thrown in at the deep end of a multiple homicide investigation, and Frank Sobotka a union leader who turned to crime to raise funds to save his union. Also joining the show in season 2 were [[Nick Sobotka]] ([[Pablo Schreiber]]), Frank's nephew; [[Ziggy Sobotka]] ([[James Ransone]]), Frank's troubled son; and "[[The Greek]]" ([[Bill Raymond]]), Vondas's mysterious boss. As the second season ended, the focus shifted away from the ports, leaving the new characters behind. The [[The Wire (season 3)#Cast|third season]] saw several previously recurring characters assuming larger starring roles, including Detective [[Leander Sydnor]] ([[Corey Parker Robinson]]), Bodie (J.D. Williams), Omar (Michael K. Williams), [[Proposition Joe]] ([[Robert F. Chew]]), and Major [[Howard "Bunny" Colvin]] ([[Robert Wisdom]]). Colvin commanded the Western district where the Barksdale organization operated, and nearing retirement, he came up with a radical new method of dealing with the drug problem. Proposition Joe, the East Side's cautious drug kingpin, became more cooperative with the [[Barksdale Organization]]. Sydnor, a rising young star in the police department in season 1, returned to the cast as part of the major crimes unit. Bodie had been seen gradually rising in the Barksdale organization since the first episode; he was born to their trade and showed a fierce aptitude for it. Omar had a vendetta against the Barksdale organization and gave them all of his lethal attention. New additions in the third season included [[Tommy Carcetti]] ([[Aidan Gillen]]), an ambitious city councilman; Mayor [[Clarence Royce]] ([[Glynn Turman]]), the incumbent whom Carcetti planned to unseat; [[Marlo Stanfield]] ([[Jamie Hector]]), leader of an upstart gang seeking to challenge Avon's dominance; and [[Dennis "Cutty" Wise]] ([[Chad Coleman]]), a newly released convict uncertain of his future. In the [[The Wire (season 4)#Cast|fourth season]], four young actors joined the cast: [[Jermaine Crawford]] as [[Duquan "Dukie" Weems]]; [[Maestro Harrell]] as [[Randy Wagstaff]]; Julito McCullum as [[Namond Brice]]; and [[Tristan Wilds]] as [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael Lee]]. The characters are friends from a West Baltimore middle school. Another newcomer was [[Norman Wilson (The Wire)|Norman Wilson]] ([[Reg E. Cathey]]), Carcetti's deputy campaign manager. The [[The Wire (season 5)#Cast|fifth season]] saw several actors join the starring cast. [[Gbenga Akinnagbe]] returns as the previously recurring [[Chris Partlow]], chief enforcer of the now dominant [[Stanfield Organization]]. [[Neal Huff]] reprises his role as Mayoral chief of staff [[Michael Steintorf]] having previously appeared as a guest star at the end of the fourth season. Two other actors also join the starring cast having previously portrayed their corrupt characters as guest stars&mdash;[[Michael Kostroff]] as defense attorney [[Maurice Levy (The Wire)|Maurice Levy]] and [[Isiah Whitlock, Jr.]] as senator [[Clay Davis]]. Crew member [[Clark Johnson]] appeared in front of the camera for the first time in the series to play [[Augustus Haynes]], the principled editor of the city desk of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]''. He is joined in the newsroom by two other new stars; [[Michelle Paress]] and [[Thomas McCarthy (actor)|Tom McCarthy]] play young reporters [[Alma Gutierrez]] and [[Scott Templeton]]. == Plot ==<!-- episode list contains detailed plot synopsis, this is intended as an overview only --> {{Main|List of The Wire episodes}} === Season 1 === {{Main|The Wire (season 1)}} The first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore police department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family. The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes. The investigation is triggered when detective [[Jimmy McNulty]] meets privately with judge [[Daniel Phelan]] following the acquittal of [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] for murder after a key witness changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness has probably been intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, [[Avon Barksdale]], having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, [[Stringer Bell]]. He also tells Phelan that nobody is investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes a significant portion of the city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides. Phelan takes issue with McNulty's report and complains to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, owing to the department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, [[Cedric Daniels]], acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police. Meanwhile, the organized and cautious Barksdale gang is explored through characters at various levels within it. The organization is continually antagonized by a stick-up crew led by [[Omar Little]], and the feud leads to several deaths. Throughout, D'Angelo struggles with his conscience over his life of crime and the people it affects. The police have little success with street-level arrests or with securing informants beyond [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]], a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes the direction of electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale's is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective [[Kima Greggs]] is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response from the rest of the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation. Wallace is murdered by his childhood friends [[Bodie Broadus|Bodie]] and [[Poot Carr|Poot]], on orders from Stringer Bell, after leaving his "secure" placement with relatives and returning to Baltimore. D'Angelo Barksdale is eventually arrested transporting a kilo of uncut heroin, and learning of Wallace's murder, is ready to turn in his uncle and Stringer. However, D'Angelo's mother convinces him to rescind the deal and take the charges for his family. The detail manages to arrest Avon on a minor charge and gets one of his soldiers, [[Wee-Bey Brice|Wee-Bey]], to confess to most of the murders, some of which he did not commit. Stringer escapes prosecution and is left running the Barksdale empire. For the officers, the consequences of antagonizing their superiors are severe, with Daniels passed over for promotion and McNulty assigned out of homicide and into the marine unit. === Season 2 === {{Main|The Wire (season 2)}} The second season, along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by [[stevedore]]s in the [[Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore|city port]], as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port.<ref name="TGU"/> In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon's imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power. McNulty harbors a grudge against his former commanders for reassigning him to the marine unit. When thirteen unidentified young women are found dead in a container at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major [[Stanislaus Valchek|Stan Valchek]] gets into a feud with [[Frank Sobotka]], a leader of the International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers' union, over competing donations to their old neighborhood church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. [[Cedric Daniels]] is interviewed, having been praised by [[Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski|Prez]], Major Valchek's son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing. Life for the blue-collar men of the port is increasingly hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed for this kind of influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container that was supposed to be smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards [[The Greek]], the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has contacts inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation. After a dispute over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka's son [[Ziggy Sobotka|Ziggy]] is charged with the murder of one of the Greek's underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] in the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The investigation ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail. Across town, the Barksdale organization continues its business under [[Stringer Bell|Stringer]] while [[Avon Barksdale|Avon]] and [[D'Angelo Barksdale]] serve prison time. D'Angelo decides to cut ties to his family after his uncle organizes the deaths of several inmates and blames it on a corrupt guard to shave time from his sentence. Eventually Stringer covertly orders D'Angelo killed, with the murder staged to look like a suicide. Avon is unaware of Stringer's duplicity and mourns the loss of his nephew. Stringer also struggles, having been cut off by Avon's drug suppliers and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named [[Proposition Joe]] in exchange for a share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named [[Street level characters of The Wire#Brother Mouzone|Brother Mouzone]]. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary [[Omar Little|Omar]] into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls [[9-1-1]]. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe. === Season 3 === {{Main|The Wire (season 3)}} In the third season, the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization. The scope, however, is expanded to include the city's political scene. A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential positive effects of ''de facto'' "legalizing" the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks — referred to as ''[[Hamsterdam]]''. The posited benefits, as in [[Amsterdam]] and other European cities, are reduced street crime city-wide and increased outreach of health and social services to at-risk populations. These are continuations of storylines hinted at earlier. The demolition of the residential towers that had served as the Barksdale organization's prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. [[Stringer Bell]] continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product, and profits. Stringer's proposal is met with a curt refusal from [[Marlo Stanfield]], leader of a new, growing crew. Against Stringer's advice, Avon decides to take Marlo's territory by force, and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. [[Omar Little]] continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend, Dante, and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for [[Cedric Daniels]]' now-permanent Major Crimes Unit. Councilman [[Tommy Carcetti]] begins to prepare himself for a mayoral race. He manipulates a colleague into running against the mayor to split the black vote, secures a capable campaign manager and starts making headlines for himself. As he approaches the end of his career, Major [[Howard "Bunny" Colvin]] of Baltimore's Western District wants to effect some real change in the troubled neighborhoods for which he has long been responsible. Without the knowledge of central command, Colvin sets up areas where police would monitor, but not punish, the drug trade. The police crack down severely on violence in these areas, and also on drug trafficking elsewhere in the city. For many weeks, Colvin's experiment works, and crime is reduced in his district. However, Colvin' superiors, the media, and city politicians eventually find out about the arrangement, and the "Hamsterdam" experiment ends. With top brass outraged, Colvin is forced to cease his actions, accept a demotion, and retire from the police department on a lower-grade pension. Tommy Carcetti uses the scandal to make a grandstanding speech at a weekly Baltimore city council meeting. [[Dennis "Cutty" Wise]], once a drug dealer's enforcer, is released from prison alongside Avon. His struggles to adapt to life as a free man show an attempt at personal reform. Cutty tries to work as a manual laborer and then flirts with his former life, going to work for Avon. Finding he no longer has the heart for murder, he eventually uses funding from Avon to purchase new equipment for his nascent boxing gym. The Major Crimes Unit learns that Stringer has been buying real estate and developing it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman. Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for, Stringer gives Major Colvin information on Avon's weapons stash. But Stringer is himself being betrayed by Avon: [[Street level characters of The Wire#Brother Mouzone|Brother Mouzone]] had returned to Baltimore and tracked down Omar to join forces. Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged. Avon, remembering how Stringer disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer attempting to have Brother Mouzone killed, possibly still furious over [[D'Angelo Barksdale|D'Angelo's]] murder (Stringer having finally confessed the truth), and fearing Mouzone's ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore, informs Mouzone of Stringer's upcoming visit to his construction site. There, Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death. Colvin tells McNulty about Avon's hideout, and armed with the information gleaned from selling the Barksdale crew pre-wiretapped disposable cell phones, the detail stages a raid, arresting Avon and most of his underlings. Barksdale's criminal empire lies in ruins, and Marlo's young crew simply moves into their territory. The drug trade in West Baltimore continues with little change. === Season 4 === {{Main|The Wire (season 4)}} The fourth season expanded its scope again to include an examination of the school system. Other major plots include the mayoral race that continues the political storyline begun in season three, and a closer look at [[Marlo Stanfield]]'s drug gang, which has grown to control most of western Baltimore's trafficking. The show introduces [[Duquan "Dukie" Weems|Dukie]], [[Randy Wagstaff|Randy]], [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael]], and [[Namond Brice|Namond]], four boys from West Baltimore, as they enter the eighth grade. At the same school, [[Roland "Prez" Pryzbylewski|Prez]] has begun a new career as a math teacher. Despite mentorship from the more seasoned faculty, Namond, and later Michael, work as drug runners for [[Bodie Broadus|Bodie]], who has had middling success selling [[Proposition Joe]]'s product independently. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers [[Chris Partlow]] and [[Snoop (The Wire)|Snoop]] conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up [[row house]]s where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him. [[Jimmy McNulty|McNulty]] has found peace working as a patrolman and living with [[Beadie Russell]], and refuses promotions from [[Cedric Daniels|Daniels]], now a major commanding the Western District. Detectives [[Kima Greggs]] and [[Lester Freamon]], as part of the major crimes unit, investigate [[Avon Barksdale]]'s political donations and serve several key figures with subpoenas. Their work is shut down by Commissioner [[Ervin Burrell]] at Mayor [[Clarence Royce]]'s request, and after being placed under stricter supervision within their unit, both Greggs and Freamon request and receive transfer to the homicide division. Meanwhile, the city's mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks. Royce initially has a seemingly insurmountable lead over challengers [[Tommy Carcetti]] and [[Politicians of The Wire#Anthony Gray|Tony Gray]], with a big [[war chest]] and major endorsements. Royce's lead begins to fray, however, as his own political machinations turn against him and Carcetti starts to highlight the city's crime problem. Carcetti is propelled to victory in the primary election. [[Howard "Bunny" Colvin]] joins a research group attempting to study potential future criminals in the middle school population. [[Dennis "Cutty" Wise]] continues to work with boys in his boxing gym, and accepts a job at the school rounding up truants. [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]] takes a homeless teenager named Sherrod under his wing. He encourages the boy to attend class, which he fails to do. Prez has a few successes with his students, but some of them start to slip away. Disruptive Namond is removed from class and placed in the research group, where he gradually develops affection and respect for Colvin. Randy, in a moment of desperation, reveals knowledge of a murder to the assistant principal, leading to his being interrogated by police. [[Proposition Joe]] engineers a conflict between [[Omar Little]] and Marlo to convince Marlo to join the [[New Day Co-Op]]. After Omar robs Marlo, Marlo frames Omar for a murder and attempts to have him murdered in jail, but Omar manages to beat the charge with the help of Bunk. Omar learns Marlo set him up, and gets revenge on him and Proposition Joe by robbing the entire shipment of the Co-Op. Meanwhile, the co-op members, including Marlo, are furious at Joe for allowing the shipment to be stolen. Marlo demands satisfaction, and as a result, Joe sets up a meeting between him and [[Spiros Vondas]], who assuages Marlo's concerns. Having gotten a lead on Joe's connection to the Greeks, Marlo begins investigating them to learn more about their role in bringing narcotics into Baltimore. Freamon discovers the bodies Chris and Snoop had hidden. Bodie offers McNulty testimony against Marlo and his crew, but is shot dead on his corner by <!--DON'T CHANGE TO MICHAEL. IT WAS O-DOG.

Bubbles turns himself in to the police and tries to hang himself, but he survives and is taken to a [[detoxification|detox]] facility. Michael has now joined the ranks of Marlo's killers and runs one of his corners, with Dukie leaving high school to work there. Randy's house is firebombed by school bullies for his cooperation with the police, leaving his caring foster mother hospitalized and sending him back to a group home. Namond is taken in by Colvin, who recognized the good in him. The major crimes unit from earlier seasons is largely reunited, and they resume their investigation of Marlo Stanfield. === Season 5 === {{Main|The Wire (season 5)}} The fifth season focuses on the media and media consumption.<ref name = "Slate">{{cite news|author = Jacob Weisberg|title = The Wire on Fire: Analyzing the best show on television|page = 1|publisher = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date = September 13, 2006|url = http://www.slate.com/id/2149566/}}</ref> The show features a fictional depiction of the newspaper ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events (such as the [[Jayson Blair]] ''New York Times'' scandal) and people at the ''Sun''.<ref name="autogenerated1">NPR interview with Simon broadcast the week of Jan. 12, 2008</ref> The season, according to [[David Simon]], deals with "what stories get told and what don't and why it is that things stay the same."<ref name="Slate"/> Issues such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number of reporters, and the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness. Fifteen months after the fourth season concludes, [[Tommy Carcetti|Mayor Carcetti]]'s cuts in the police budget to redress the education deficit force the [[Marlo Stanfield]] investigation to shut down. [[Cedric Daniels]] secures a detail to focus on the prosecution of [[Clay Davis|Senator Davis]] for corruption. [[Jimmy McNulty|Detective McNulty]] returns to the Homicide unit and decides to divert resources back to the police department by faking evidence to make it appear that a serial killer is murdering homeless men. ''The Baltimore Sun'' also faces budget cuts and the newsroom struggles to adequately cover the city, omitting many important stories. [[Ervin Burrell|Commissioner Burrell]] continues to falsify crime statistics and is fired by Carcetti, who positions Daniels to replace him. Marlo Stanfield lures his enemy [[Omar Little]] out of retirement by having Omar's mentor [[Omar Little and associates#Butchie|Butchie]] murdered. [[Proposition Joe]] teaches Stanfield how to launder money and evade investigation. Once Joe is no longer useful to him, Stanfield has Joe killed with the help of Joe's nephew [[Cheese Wagstaff]] and usurps his position with the Greeks and the [[New Day Co-Op]]. [[Michael Lee (The Wire)|Michael Lee]] continues working as a Stanfield enforcer, providing a home for his friend [[Duquan "Dukie" Weems|Dukie]] and younger brother [[School system of The Wire#Aaron "Bug" Manigault|Bug]]. Omar returns to Baltimore seeking revenge, targeting Stanfield's organization, stealing and destroying money and drugs and killing Stanfield enforcers in an attempt to force Stanfield into the open. However, he is eventually shot and killed by [[Stanfield Organization#Kenard|Kenard]], a young Stanfield dealer. ''Baltimore Sun'' reporter Scott Templeton claims to have been contacted by McNulty's fake serial killer. City Editor [[Augustus Haynes|Gus Haynes]] becomes suspicious, but his superiors are enamored of Templeton. The story gains momentum and Carcetti spins the resulting attention on homelessness into a key issue in his imminent campaign for Governor and restores funding to the police department. [[Bubbles (The Wire)|Bubbles]] is recovering from his drug addiction while living in his sister's basement. He is befriended by ''Sun'' reporter [[Journalists of The Wire#Mike Fletcher|Mike Fletcher]], who eventually writes a profile of Bubbles. Bunk is disgusted with McNulty's serial killer scheme and tries to have [[Lester Freamon]] reason with McNulty. Instead, Freamon helps McNulty perpetuate the lie and uses resources earmarked for the case to fund an illegal wiretap on Stanfield. Bunk resumes working the vacant house murders, leading to a murder warrant against Partlow for killing Michael's stepfather. Freamon and [[Leander Sydnor]] gather enough evidence to arrest Stanfield and most of his top lieutenants, seizing a large quantity of drugs. Stanfield suspects that Michael is an informant, and orders him killed. Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop instead. A wanted man, he leaves Bug with an aunt and begins a career as a stick-up man. With his support system gone, Dukie lives with drug addicts. McNulty tells [[Kima Greggs]] about his fabrications to prevent her wasting time on the case. Greggs tells Daniels, who, along with [[Rhonda Pearlman]], takes this news to Carcetti, who orders a cover-up because of the issue's importance to his campaign. Davis is acquitted, but Freamon uses the threat of federal prosecution to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release on the condition that he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner. As the cover-up begins, a [[Copycat crime|copy-cat]] killing occurs, but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit. Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon that they can no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts to expose Templeton but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked. In a final montage, McNulty gazes over the city; Freamon enjoys retirement; Templeton wins a Pulitzer; Carcetti becomes Governor; Haynes is sidelined to the copy desk and replaced by Fletcher; Campbell appoints Valchek as commissioner; Carcetti appoints Rawls as Superintendent of the Maryland State Police; [[Duquan "Dukie" Weems|Dukie]] continues to use heroin; Michael becomes a stickup boy; Pearlman becomes a judge and Daniels a defense attorney; Bubbles is allowed upstairs where he enjoys a family dinner; Chris serves his life sentence alongside [[Wee-Bey Brice|Wee-Bey]]; the drug trade continues; and the people of Baltimore go on with their lives. === Prequel shorts === During the fifth season, HBO produced three short prequels depicting moments in the history of characters in ''The Wire''.
